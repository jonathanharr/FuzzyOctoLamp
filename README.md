# FuzzyOctoLamp

## About

This project serves as a demonstration of pipelines, CI/CD and DevOps practices. The project aims to bring some fun into the mix by lighting up my smartlamps in my face while I talk about DevOps and pipelines.

## How to use

If you want to make use of my project, you will probably have to fork it. Since it's quite connected to my smartlamps from Philips Hue.
